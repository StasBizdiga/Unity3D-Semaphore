# Unity3D-Semaphore
Windows Programming Lab 5
## Scheme:
(1) Bizdiga Stas | Project assembly/management, code merging, user input

(2) Calancea Dan | Coding the business logic

(3) Istratii Victor | Design, aesthetics and animations

### To do's: 
##### NOTE: These are tasks for 6 grade
##### NOTE: Tasks with (1),(2) or (3) are "tagged" (see team tags above)
- (3) Make 4 semaphores with intermittent green/red lights
- (2,3) Add semaphore logic (tip: store the lights state in a global bool)
- (1,2) Make user able to change semaphore light faser/slower due user input
- (1) Make user able to increase the number of generated random cars
- (2) Self-driving-car AI
--------------------------------------
#### For later: 
##### NOTE: These are tasks for 8-10 grade
- Add 2 crosswalks with people passing.
- Random special cars crossing (at least 2; ex. ambulance, president care, police car, etc)
- Car accident generated by the wrong crossing of the car/pedestrian or presence of drunk driver 
#### Bonus point:
##### 1 point per each new added creative idea. [ open for suggestions ]
- Crosswalk person == User controlled 
- Drunk car == User controlled
- Shift between top-down and FPS view (of the person at crosswalk)
