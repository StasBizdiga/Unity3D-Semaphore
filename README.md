# Unity3D-Semaphore
Windows Programming Lab 5
## Scheme:
(1) Bizdiga Stas | Project assembly/management, code merging, user input

(2) Calancea Dan | Coding the business logic

(3) Istratii Victor | Design, aesthetics and animations

### To do's [All done!]: 
##### NOTE: Tasks with (1),(2) or (3) are "tagged" (see team tags above)
##### NOTE: These are tasks for 6 grade
- (3) Make 4 semaphores with intermittent green/red lights
- (2,3) Add semaphore logic (tip: store the lights state in a global bool)
- (1,2) Make user able to change semaphore light faser/slower due user input
- (1) Make user able to increase the number of generated random cars
- (2) Self-driving-car AI
##### NOTE: These are tasks for 8-10 grade
- (1,2,3) Add 2 crosswalks with people passing.
- (1,3) Random special cars crossing (at least 2; ex. ambulance, president care, police car, etc)
#### Bonus point:
##### 1 point per each new added creative idea.
- (1) Cycle between four cameras with C key; visual day-night cycle
- (2) Ability to choose first person view (as a person at crosswalk)

#### HotKeys help
numpad multiply/divide - controls the amount of pedestrians & cars created.

numpad add/subtract - controls the amount of time for semaphore to change colors.

V - enter/exit First Person mode

(use WASD to move around and mouse to look)

C - cycle cameras

R - reset simulation

esc - exit application
